# Dispatch Rider System

This is a test version of a dispatch rider system. 

## Get Started

You can either `cd` into each directory and run the separate stacks as individual applications, or use the included `docker-compose.yml` file to spin everything up under Docker containers.

```sh
docker compose up
```
